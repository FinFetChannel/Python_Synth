# Python_Synth
A simple synthetizer made with Pygame and Numpy in Python.
## What is a soundwave
Soundwaves are pressure fluctuations which travel trough the air (or other physical medium) and hit your eardrums. We can generate these waves with a speaker, which usually consists of a dyaphragm wuth an electrical coil attached and a permanent magnet. When an electrical signal passed through the coil it vibrates the diaphragm and which in turn moves the air around it creating soundwaves.
The electrical signal consists of an alternating current, usually created by a DAC - Digital Analog Converter and amplified bya a amplifier. Before that, the signal is digital, consisting of ones and zeros in your computer.
And what does this digital signal look like? Basically it is a long list of numbers.
## Generating a digital signal
The first thing we should consider when generating a digital signal is the sampling rate, that is, how many values we need to define for a second of sound. The default value for the Pygame mixer is 41000 samples per second, so that's what I'll be using.
The second thing is the form of the wave, the most pure sound wave is the sine, also one of the easiest to generate in numpy, but the are inumerous other types, like square, triangular and sawtooth.
We will start with the sine wave, which will actually be generated by the cosine function (makes things easier for triangular waves later). Cosine is equal to sine but with a fase shift, which is not relevant in this context.
